# Lemmy CSS

This repository contains a custom CSS style for Lemmy, aimed at enhancing it's visual appearance. While browsing, I came across a stylish theme on [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/10345/lemmy-world) that caught my attention. However, since I personally prefer dark themes, I made some modifications to the colors and adjusted the radiuses and margins to create a darker version.

## Installation

To apply this style to your Lemmy instance, follow these steps:

1. Visit [userstyles.world/style/10416/lemmy-dark-theme](https://userstyles.world/style/10416/lemmy-dark-theme).
2. Click on "Get stylus" and install the Stylus browser extension.
3. Once Stylus is installed, click the "Install style" button on [userstyles.world/style/10416/lemmy-dark-theme](https://userstyles.world/style/10416/lemmy-dark-theme).
4. Open the Lemmy settings and set the theme to "darkly" to finalize the using experience.

Please note that if you are using an instance other than lemmy.world, lemmy.ml, feddit.de, or beehaw.org, you will need to add your instance's domain to the style code.

Additionally, I have created another theme with a different color scheme. Here is an image of the grey theme:
